* Activity: each of the activities performed by the subjects (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying)
* Subject_id: a number from 1 to 30 which identifies each of the participants.
* The remaining 66 variables are the average of the means and standard deviations from the measurements described in the README.txt file included in the UCI-HAR dataset (all this variables are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]).
